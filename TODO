Now: (current focus)
  add results from first playout moves to tree
  change from progressive widening to biasing
  move playout code out of engine
  change uct_* params to tree_*
  use RAVE together with Features for unpruning?
  larger patterns

Soon: (before next major release)
  implement superko in tree
  tune parameters
  try UCB1-TUNED formula (p.216(169) in SylvainGellyThesis)
  try a "global RAVE"
  try use parent info in children (or grand parent)
  implement the mercy rule?
  make atari-aware playouts dependant on size of group?

  progressively add more reward for points diff if winrate very good?
  add hg tracked cgos,kgs?,gomill? scripts
  make SL page
  update surewin during genmove
  reduce thinking time if surewin?
  think for longer if needed
  keep track of board hashes incrementally
  speedup features in playouts
  try LGRF-1/2 with a variable queue
  progressive widening occurs related to "factor" (features)
  setting to filter boardsize, time_settings, etc. for kgs
  setting to use a total number of playouts per game for time testing
  patterns only near last move?
  fillboard not on 1st/2nd line?
  tune how much progressive widening can depend on winrate
  make sure scoring at end of kgs ranked game works (opponent can't "cheat")
  check for Mogo patterns quickly?
  reduce expand_after?
  tune fillboard's N
  support terminal jigo in tree
  use Benson algo in tree and playouts
  use Criticality as a feature

Later: (at some point)
  make sure install works and is described somewhere
  add handicap settings
  add timestamp to log?
  replace FunctionList and ConstantList with std::list<>
  rename/refactor Engine to better name?
  move Go:: objects into own files?
  move main() into Oakfoam.cc
  add prefix to custom commands?
  do sanity checks on parameters
  document parameters
  use rotational symmetry?
  copy all board data with a copy() (groups and liberties)
  extensive comparison of playouts with strength
  add more debug messages and debug levels
  more regression testing
  add loadsgf command
