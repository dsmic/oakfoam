TODO
------------------

Now: (before next release)
  store liberties better or not individually
  store neighbour counts for each board position? (num of empty...)
  try add simple 16-bit patterns to playouts (must be fast)
  handle terminal nodes properly (don't do playouts from terminal)

Soon: (before next major release)
  implement superko in tree
  copy all board data with a copy() (groups and liberties)
  investigate slow ppmi in trials after a while (possibly CPU overheating)
  improve time managment
  divide parameters into classes?
  do running average for ppmi?
  tune parameters
  add slight bonus to ratio for pts diff?
  try use thrown away part of tree
  do comparison of playouts with strength
  try a "global RAVE"
  place a limit of sorts on depth? (expand after more plts)
  try use parent info in children (or grand parent)
  implement the mercy rule?
  add command to output tree (to SGF?)
  play a move early if it is clearly the right move?
  try UCB-TUNED forumla
  replace floats with integers in tree
  only try escape if it gains a liberty
  make atari-aware playouts dependant on size of group?
  avoid self-atari in playouts with a group size over x
  play at one of liberties of a enemy group with 2
  prefer closer moves using CFG to last and next-to-last move

Later: (at some point)
  add handicap settings
  add timestamp to log?
  add an opening book?
  replace FunctionList and ConstantList with std::list<>
  rename/refactor Engine to better name?
  move Go:: objects into own files?
  move main() into Oakfoam.cc
  add prefix to custom commands?
  do sanity checks on parameters
  document parameters
