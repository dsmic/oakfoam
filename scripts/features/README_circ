- Scripts for Features

requirements:
  GoGui (http://gogui.sourceforge.net)
  MM tool by Remi Coulom (see mm-fetch.sh)

example usage:
  1. Harvest circ patterns (played) with example size of 13 from a collection of games:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | harvest-collection-circular-played-parallel.sh 13 > patt.dat
  2. Harvest circ patterns (not played) with example size of 13 from a collection of games:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | harvest-collection-circular-not-played-parallel.sh 13 > patt.dat

(tmp files may stay in the directory!)

this pattern databases have to be loaded into oakfoam using
loadcircpatterns /home/detlef/oakfoam-hg/oakfoam/scripts/features/pattern9_100000games_not_played 30000

loadcircpatternsnot /home/detlef/oakfoam-hg/oakfoam/scripts/features/pattern9_100000games_not_played 100000

where 30000 and 100000 give the number of lines used from the database.
