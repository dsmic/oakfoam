- Opening Book Script
-------------------------------

The 'book-fetch.sh' script downloads the current opening book of
Fuego and places in the project root for Oakfoam to use. This is
a temporary solution, hopefully Oakfoam will have its own
opening book at some stage. Please refer to
http://fuego.sourceforge.net/ for more info on Fuego.
