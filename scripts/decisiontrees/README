- Scripts for Decision Trees
--------------------------------------

NOTE: This work is still under heavy construction

Requirements:
  GoGui (http://gogui.sourceforge.net)
  MM tool by Remi Coulom (see mm-fetch.sh)
  
Example Usage:
  1. Create a new blank decision tree collection:
    $ cp dt_blank.dat dt.dat
  2. Grow the collection from 100 random games in a collection: (this step can be repeated as necessary)
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | shuf -n 100 | ./dt-grow.sh dt.dat
  3. Train weights for the tree leaf nodes:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | shuf -n 100 | ./dt-train.sh dt.dat
  4. Test the results:
    TODO

Scripts:
  dt-grow.sh
    - Grow a decision tree from a series of games
    eg: $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | ./dt-grow.sh dt.dat
  dt-train.sh
    - Train weights for a decision tree from a series of games
    eg: $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | ./dt-train.sh dt.dat
  mm-fetch.sh
    - Download and make the MM tool, used for training leaf weights
    eg: $ ./mm-fetch.sh
