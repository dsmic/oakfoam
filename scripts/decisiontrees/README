- Scripts for Decision Trees
--------------------------------------

NOTE: This work is still under heavy construction

Requirements:
  GoGui (http://gogui.sourceforge.net)
  MM tool by Remi Coulom (see mm-fetch.sh)
  
Example Usage:
  1. Create a new blank decision tree collection:
    $ cp dt_blank.dat dt.dat
  2. Grow the collection from 100 random games in a collection:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | shuf -n 100 | ./dt-grow.sh dt.dat 1
  3. Train weights for the tree leaf nodes:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | shuf -n 100 | ./dt-train.sh dt.dat 1
  4. Test the results:
    $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | shuf -n 100 | ./dt-compare.sh dt.dat > res.txt

Scripts:
  dt-grow.sh
    - Grow a decision tree from a series of games.
      The 2nd argument specifies if the stats should be preserved (0) or dropped (1).
    eg: $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | ./dt-grow.sh dt.dat [0|1]
  dt-train.sh
    - Train weights for a decision tree from a series of games.
    eg: $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | ./dt-train.sh dt.dat [0|1]
  dt-compare.sh
    - Compare trained decision tree with a series of games.
    eg: $ ls sgfs/*.sgf | ./dt-compare.sh dt.dat > res.txt
  mm-fetch.sh
    - Download and make the MM tool, used for training leaf weights.
    eg: $ ./mm-fetch.sh
